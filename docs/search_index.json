The population correlation is a measure of the magnitude of the strength of the relationship between two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho(X,Y) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)\\text{Var}(Y)}}, \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] and can be estimated by replacing each of \\(\\text{Cov}(X,Y)\\), \\(\\text{Var}(X)\\) and \\(\\text{Var}(Y)\\) by their unbiased estimators to give \\[\\begin{equation} r = \\frac{S_{xy}}{\\sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}}=\\frac{\\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}}, \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] the sample correlation coefficient (\\(-1 \\le r \\le 1\\)). Given a sample of data, we can assess the statistical significance of the observed correlations between variables in the wider population. To do this we perform a hypothesis test (more on this in Example 1). "],["example-1-correlation.html", "2 Example 1: Correlation 2.1 Exploratory analysis 2.2 Population correlation hypothesis test 2.3 Calculating the correlation by hand", " 2 Example 1: Correlation In an experiment conducted by the GU physiology department, a sample of volunteers had their power output measured (in watts) while they ran up stairs as fast as possible under different test conditions. Their gender was noted and their weight and leg length measurements recorded. The data are available from the csv file phys1.csv. To open this data file in RStudio type: phys &lt;- read.csv(&quot;phys1.csv&quot;) This will assign the data to the object phys. This worksheet contains six columns, described as follows:              C1: Gender              C2: Weight (kgs)              C3: Leg Length (metres)              C4: Power1: Power output in the stair test              C5: Power2: Power output in a test with a ramp on the stairs              C6: Power3: Power output with ramp on the stairs and a fixed stride length You can view these names by typing names(phys). 2.1 Exploratory analysis QUESTION: Produce a scatterplot to examine the relationship between Power1 and Weight. Solution plot(Power1 ~ Weight, data = phys) Producing labelled scatterplots The simple scatterplot may have ignored the possibility that any relationship between these variables might be different for males and females. So, we now label the plot according to the gender of the subjects. The following provides one approach to doing this in RStudio. The variable Gender within the data is a factor with two levels: Male and Female. Firstly, we will create a character variable for Gender, by using the command: Gender1 &lt;- as.character(phys$Gender) We can now use this new object to label the points by gender. This can be done by typing the following: plot(Power1 ~ Weight, data = phys, xlab = &quot;Weight (kgs)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Power Output (Watts)&quot;, pch = Gender1) which produces the scatterplot given in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: Scatterplot of Power1 versus Weight with gender highlighted. DISCUSSION: What can we say about the relationship between Power1 and Weight for males and females separately? The plotting characters (as well as colour) highlighting males and females can also be chosen using numerical characters in R. For example, Gender2 &lt;- as.numeric(phys$Gender) 2.2 Population correlation hypothesis test Here we would like to assess the strength of the relationship, if any, between Power1 and Weight. We are going to do this for male and female volunteers separately, such that we assess the statistical significance of the observed correlation between these two variables in the wider populations of (i) males and (ii) females. Firstly, we subset the data for males and females. One way to do this is: physM &lt;- subset(phys, Gender == &quot;Male&quot;, data = phys) physF &lt;- subset(phys, Gender == &quot;Female&quot;, data = phys) We now perform, separately for males and females, the following hypothesis test: \\(H_0: \\rho=0\\) vs. \\(H_1:\\rho \\ne 0\\) We test the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\), that is, that in the population of males/females the correlation between Power Output and Weight is 0 against the alternative hypothesis, \\(H_1\\), that the correlation is not equal to 0. To compute the sample correlation coefficient, \\(r\\), and perform our hypothesis test, we use the cor.test command. For the males data, the command is as follows: cor.test(physM$Power1, physM$Weight) Note: in the cor.test command the $ notation is required to access the variables from the subsetted data. The hypothesis test produces a \\(p\\)-value, where we reject the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\), for small values of the \\(p\\)-value (typically \\(p\\)-values \\(&lt; 0.05\\)). It also produces a 95% confidence interval for a range of plausible values for the true population correlation. QUESTION: What is the sample correlation coefficient for the males data? What is the \\(p\\)-value for the test? The sample correlation coefficient tells us that Power Output and Weight for males have a weakstrong, positivenegative, linearnon-linear relationship. Based on the \\(p\\)-value of the test, we would reject the null hypothesisreject the alternative hypothesisfail to reject the null hypothesisfail to reject the alternative hypothesis and conclude that \\(\\rho\\) is significantly different from zerois not significantly different from zero. Now repeat the hypothesis test for the females data. QUESTION: What is the sample correlation coefficient for the females data? What is the \\(p\\)-value for the test? The sample correlation coefficient tells us that Power Output and Weight for females have a weakstrong, positivenegative, linearnon-linear relationship. Based on the \\(p\\)-value of the test, we would reject the null hypothesisreject the alternative hypothesisfail to reject the null hypothesisfail to reject the alternative hypothesis and conclude that \\(\\rho\\) is significantly different from zerois not significantly different from zero. Note: if we do not subset the data by gender, we obtain a sample correlation coefficient \\(r = 0.89\\), with a \\(p\\)-value \\(\\leq 0.05\\), and thus we would conclude that there is a strong, positive linear relationship between Power Output and Weight. However, we now know that is not the case for females. 2.3 Calculating the correlation by hand "],["exercise-1-spurious-correlation.html", "3 Exercise 1: Spurious correlation", " 3 Exercise 1: Spurious correlation Nicholas Cage data Hollywood legend Nicholas Cage seems to have a problem. It appears that every time he releases a new film upon the world many people drown by falling into pools of water. Coincidence? Or, are some of his films that bad? Data: Cage.csv Columns:               C1: Year Year of film releases               C2: NumFilms   Number of Nicholas Cage films released that year               C3: NumDrowns Number of people who drowned falling into pools that year Read in the data using: Cage &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Cage.csv&quot;) TASK Produce a scatterplot of NumDrowned (y) against NumFilms (x). What can we say about their relationship? Use the cor.test command to perform a correlation hypothesis test. What does this tell us about the relationship between NumDrowned and NumFilms? Hint What is the sample correlation coefficient and how to interpret this value? What is \\(p\\)-value associated with the hypothesis test and how to interpret this value? This is an example of spurious correlation, where two variables that are not related to each other in any way, that is, they are independent, could be inferred as being related. The number of Nicholas Cage films released in a year is clearly not related to the number of drowning accidents in that same year, but if we just take our correlation hypothesis test on face value, then we would think otherwise.
