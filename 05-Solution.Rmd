# Solution

Task 

(a) Producing a scatterplot
```{r}
plot(NumDrowned ~ NumFilms, data = Cage, xlab = "Number of Nicholas Cage films released in a year", ylab = "Number of people who drowned falling into pools that year")
```

(b) Correlation test
```{r, eval=TRUE}
cor.test(Cage$NumDrowned, Cage$NumFilms)
```

The sample correlation coefficient is 0.666, indicating a moderate positive linear relationship between **NumDrowned** and **NumFilms**. 

The $p$-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the population correlation $\rho$ is statistically significantly different from 0.
